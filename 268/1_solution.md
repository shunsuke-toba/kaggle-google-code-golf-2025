Given a grid containing a coloured frame made of a single non‑zero colour, fill the empty space enclosed by that frame with colour `4`. In addition, draw a straight diagonal line of colour `4` from the corner of the canvas opposite the frame towards the frame until the line meets the frame or the edge of the grid. Return the transformed grid.
